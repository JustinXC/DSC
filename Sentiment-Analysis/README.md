# Data Cleaning & Sentiment Analysis with Twitter 
This is a data science project using Python3 in Jupyter Notebooks. <br />
I am using a dataset of several thousand tweets using Twitter's API and determining the subjectivity and polarity of the textual data. <br />
Majority of libraries used include **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, textblob, and wordcloud.**
